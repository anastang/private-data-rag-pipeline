# Secure RAG Pipeline for Private Data ðŸ”’ 
This project demonstrates how to build a **RAG** pipeline using private documents to power a chatbot that can answer questions based on the user's private data. The goal is to securely process and store document embeddings, enabling efficient querying by the chatbot to provide data-driven responses without compromising the privacy of sensitive information.

The solution involves embedding documents using **Pinecone** and **Groq's** AI accelerators, and integrating these embeddings into a pipeline that retrieves relevant information for a LLM to generate accurate responses.


## How It Works

1. **Document Loading and Processing:** Documents are loaded, their content is extracted, and metadata (such as file names and folder names) is collected.
2. **Embedding Generation:** Text embeddings are generated using **Hugging Face** models.
3. **Embedding Storage:** The embeddings are securely stored in Pinecone under a designated namespace, allowing easy retrieval.
4. **Query Handling and Inference Acceleration:** Query Handling and Inference Acceleration: The RAG pipeline retrieves relevant documents from Pinecone based on user queries. Groq accelerates the inference process, enabling the language model to generate accurate responses faster and more efficiently by optimizing the retrieval and processing of the embeddings.


## Next Steps: Handling Video Transcripts

### Adding Video Transcript Handling

The current pipeline handles documents (e.g., PDFs, text files), but future iterations will add support for video transcripts. Hereâ€™s a rough outline of the next steps for adding this feature:

1. **Transcription**:
   - Integrate **Whisper API** (by OpenAI) or **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** API to generate transcripts from video/audio files.

2. **Embedding Transcripts**:
   - Once the transcripts are generated, treat them similarly to the document embeddings pipeline:
     - Split the transcript text into smaller chunks using LangChainâ€™s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
     - Generate embeddings for each chunk.
     - Store the embeddings in Pinecone, tagging them as transcripts in the metadata.

3. **Improved Querying**:
   - Enhance the chatbot's ability to distinguish between documents and transcripts when retrieving content for the LLM to generate responses. Metadata (e.g., "document type: transcript") can help prioritize certain content types based on the query.



By adding video transcript processing, you can expand the capabilities of the RAG pipeline to handle a wider variety of data formats and better serve real-world use cases.
